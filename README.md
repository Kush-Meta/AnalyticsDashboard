## 💾 Working with Historical Data

### Import Past Posts

If you have historical post data, you can jumpstart the learning:

**Step 1: Create CSV**

Create a file `my_posts.csv`:

```csv
platform,content,likes,comments,shares,impressions,hashtags,date
Twitter,"My amazing post! 🚀",45,8,12,2500,"tech,startup",2025-09-15
Instagram,"Check this out!",230,15,20,5800,"photo,art",2025-09-16
```

**Step 2: Import**

```bash
python import_historical_data.py my_posts.csv
```

**Step 3: View Results**

Open the app and check the Insights Dashboard!

### Create Sample CSV

```bash
python import_historical_data.py sample
```

This creates `sample_import.csv` you can use as a template.

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing Strategy

### Recommended Approach

**Week 1: Baseline**
```
- Use your normal hashtags
- Track 5 posts
- Note average engagement
```

**Week 2: AI Testing**
```
- Use ONLY AI recommendations
- Track 5 posts
- Compare to baseline
```

**Week 3: Hybrid**
```
- Mix your hashtags with AI suggestions
- Find optimal blend
- Continue tracking
```

### Tracking Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Wait 48-72 hours before tracking
- Track ALL posts (even low performers)
- Be accurate with metrics
- Track consistently

❌ **DON'T:**
- Cherry-pick only good posts
- Estimate metrics
- Track too early
- Skip tracking

---

## 📈 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Tech Blogger

**Month 1 (No Data)**
```
Posts Analyzed: 10
Average Engagement: 1.5%
Confidence: 🌱 Building
AI Recommendations: Generic tech hashtags
```

**Month 2 (Learning)**
```
Posts Tracked: 25
Average Engagement: 2.3% (+53%)
Confidence: 📊 Medium
AI Learns: #buildinpublic works well for this audience
```

**Month 3 (Optimized)**
```
Posts Tracked: 60
Average Engagement: 3.8% (+153%)
Confidence: 🎓 High
Top Hashtag: #buildinpublic (5.2% avg engagement)
Prediction Accuracy: Within 10%
```

**Result:** 2.5x improvement in 3 months!

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Database Management

**Backup Database**
```bash
cp hashtag_performance.db hashtag_performance_backup.db
```

**Reset Database**
```bash
rm hashtag_performance.db
# Restart app to create fresh database
```

**Export All Data**
Use the "Export Performance Data" button in the Insights Dashboard tab.

### Customize AI Model

Edit `app.py` line 43:

```python
self.model = "llama3.2:3b"  # Options: llama3.1, mistral, phi3
```

Smaller models (faster, less accurate):
- `llama3.2:1b` - Very fast, good for low-end hardware
- `phi3` - Microsoft's efficient model

Larger models (slower, more accurate):
- `llama3.1:8b` - Better reasoning
- `mistral:7b` - Strong alternative

### Adjust Learning Rate

The system automatically balances learned patterns with AI reasoning. To prioritize learned data more:

Edit the scoring weights in `app.py` (search for "Weighted scoring"):

```python
# More weight on historical data
scores['engagement_potential'] = int(
    scores['content_quality'] * 0.30 +
    scores['hashtag_strategy'] * 0.30 +
    scores['timing_relevance'] * 0.15 +
    scores['data_confidence'] * 0.25  # Increased from 0.10
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No data to display" in Dashboard

**Cause:** Haven't tracked any posts yet

**Solution:** 
1. Analyze a post in "Analyze Post" tab
2. Go to "Track Performance" tab
3. Enter metrics for that post

### Predictions seem off

**Cause:** Insufficient data or inconsistent tracking

**Solution:**
- Track at least 10 posts
- Ensure accurate metrics
- Wait full 48 hours before tracking

### Import script fails

**Common issues:**
- CSV formatting errors (check commas, quotes)
- Missing required columns
- Invalid platform names (must be "Twitter" or "Instagram")

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create sample to see correct format
python import_historical_data.py sample
```

### Database locked error

**Cause:** App running while trying to import

**Solution:** Close the Streamlit app, then import
